## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Frontend not loading:**

- Verify build command and publish directory
- Check for TypeScript/compilation errors

**Backend not responding:**
- Check Render logs
- Verify environment variables are set
- Check if the server is starting correctly

**Chatbot not working:**
- Verify the API URL in `src/config/api.ts`
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Verify your DeepAI API key is valid

**CORS Errors:**
- Make sure your Render server has CORS configured
- Check that the frontend URL is allowed in CORS settings

### Environment Variables Checklist
- [ ] `DEEPAI_API_KEY` set in Render
- [ ] API URL updated in `src/config/api.ts`
- [ ] Frontend rebuilt and redeployed

## üìù Notes

- The frontend will automatically use the correct API URL based on the environment
- In development, it uses `localhost:3001`
- In production, it uses your Render URL
- The ChatWindow component uses relative URLs, so it will work with any domain

## üéâ You're Done!

Your site should now be fully deployed and functional. The chatbot will work with your AI backend, and everything should be accessible online.
