## üîß How It Works

### Frontend (React App)
- **Built with Vite** and deployed as static files
- **Served from Vercel's global CDN** for fast loading
- **Automatic HTTPS** and optimization

### Backend (Serverless Functions)
- **API routes** in `/api` folder become serverless functions
- **Automatic scaling** - no cold starts
- **Global edge network** for fast API responses

## üîç Testing Your Deployment

### Test Frontend:
1. Visit your Vercel URL
2. Check that all pages load correctly
3. Test the navigation and animations

### Test Backend:
1. Visit your Vercel URL + `/api/chat`
2. You should see a response (even if it's an error, it means the server is running)

### Test Chatbot:
1. Open your deployed site
2. Click the chat button
3. Send a message to test the API connection

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Build fails:**
- Check Vercel build logs
- Verify `package.json` has correct build script
- Make sure all dependencies are in `package.json`

**API not working:**
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Verify the API route is in `/api` folder
- Check Vercel function logs

**Chatbot not responding:**
- Verify the API URL in `src/config/api.ts`
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Verify your DeepAI API key is valid

**CORS errors:**
- Vercel handles CORS automatically for same-domain requests
- If you have issues, check the CORS configuration in the API function

### Environment Variables Checklist:
- [ ] `DEEPAI_API_KEY` set in Vercel
- [ ] API URL updated in `src/config/api.ts`
- [ ] Project redeployed after environment variable changes
